# Perform Test Printng

## How do I Perform Test Printing?

**Prerequisites:** Please complete [Load/Reload Media & Ribbon](410Load), [Media Calibration](410MediaCali), [Feeding](410Feeding), [RFID Calibration](410RFIDCali) before you begin.
Check your control panel for the following indicators:

- **STATUS LIGHT**: SOLID GREEN. If light is solid red, please restart from [Media Calibration](410MediaCali).
- **PAUSE LIGHT**: UNLIT. If light is solid amber, select the pause button.
- **DATA LIGHT** = UNLIT. This indicates the printing activity.
- **SUPPLIES LIGHT** = UNLIT. If light is flashing/solid red, check ribbon/media stock. If out of stock or issue still persists even with stock, please restart from [Loading/Reloading Media & Ribbon](410Load].
- **NETWORK LIGHT** = SOLID RED. This is normal.

1. Refer to the **General User Guide > "How do I Print an Asset tag"** for instructions on printing tags from system.

2. Twist the Printhead Lever to close the Printhead Assembly.

3. Roll bag the tags. Ensure that the tags are in the **"printer default stop position"**. Refer to [Feeding](410Feeding) for more information.

4. Twist the Printhead Lever to close the Printhead Assembly.

5. Start by printing 1 tag. Make the necessary corrections before scaling up to 30 tags and finally to full scale. 
Refer to the scenarios and **corrections in bold** below:

     **a. Calibration is ok**
     - If the print falls within tag margins. Well done! No correction required, scale up testing.
     - If the print is dangerously close to the tag's edge. Perform correction in [Offset Print Position](410Offset) before scaling up testing.

     **b. Calibration is not ok**
     - If the tag reads **"VOID VOID VOID VOID VOID VOID"**, please restart from [RFID Calibration](410RFIDCali).
     - If th eprint is vastly off tag margins, please restart from [Media Calibration](410MediaCali).
     - If the printer shifts more than one tag length, please restart from [Media Calibration](410MediaCali).

Please contact your agency admin if **"Calibration is not ok"** persists beyond the **3rd try**.
