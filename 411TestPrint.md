# Perform Test Printng

## How do I Perform Test Printing?

**Prerequisites:** Please complete [Load/Reload Media & Ribbon](411Load), [Media Calibration](411MediaCali), [Feeding](411Feeding), [RFID Calibration](411RFIDCali) before you begin.

1. Refer to **General User Guide > "How do I Print an Asset tag"** for instructions on printing tags from system.

2. Twist the Printhead Lever to close the Printhead Assembly.

3. Roll bag the tags. Ensure that the tags are in the **"printer default stop position"**. Refer to [Feeding](411Feeding) for more information.

4. Twist the Printhead Lever to close the Printhead Assembly.

5. Start by printing 1 tag. 
Make the necessary corrections before scaling up to 30 tags and finally to full scale. 
Refer to the scenarios and **corrections in bold** below:

     **a. Calibration is ok**
     - If the print falls within tag margins. Well done! No correction required, scale up testing.
     - If the print is dangerously close to the tag's edge. Perform correction in [Offset Print Position](411Offset) before scaling up testing.
     - If the print is slightly off tag margins (some of the print is clipped off), perform correction in [Offset Print Position](411Offset) before scaling up testing.

     **b. Calibration is not ok**
     - If the tag reads **"VOID VOID VOID VOID VOID VOID"**, please restart from [RFID Calibration](411RFIDCali).
     - If th eprint is vastly off tag margins, please restart from [Media Calibration](411MediaCali).
     - If the printer shifts more than one tag length, please restart from [Media Calibration](411MediaCali).

Please contact your agency admin if **"Calibration is not ok"** persists beyond the **3rd try**.
